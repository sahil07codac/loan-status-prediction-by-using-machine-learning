INTRODUCTION

Aim: To determine the loan approval system using machine learning algorithms.

Synopsis:
Loan approval is a very important process for banking organizations. The systems
approved or reject the loan applications. Recovery of loans is a major contributing
parameter in the financial statements of a bank. It is very difficult to predict the possibility
of payment of loan by the customer. In recent years many researchers worked on loan
approval prediction systems. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are very useful in
predicting outcomes for large amount of data. In this paper different machine learning
algorithms are applied to predict the loan approval of customers..In this paper, various
machine learning algorithms that have been used in past are discussed and their accuracy is
evaluated. The main focus of this paper is to determine whether the loan given to a
particular person or an organization shall be approved or not.
